1 How to to create a new branch,

Run = git branch == to list all branche's,
Run = git status == to check that I am on a working clean branch,
Run = git reset == to unstage a file in the staging area [example = git reset app/index.html]

2 How to to switch between branch's,

Run = git branch == Run = git checkout == local-environ-project-spec-setup to s-asenviron-project-spec-setup = to create a new branch,
Run = git checkout == witch between local branche's
Run = git checkout master wh-teenviron-project-spec-setup = to switch to the feature branch,
Run = git checkout master to switch between branch's,

Run = git checkout == branch to MERGE BRANCHE'S
-environ-project-spec-setup = to switch between local branche's
Run = git checkout master r = when on master branch to MERGE BRANCHE'S

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

## Projects first branch "boiler-plate-house-keeping-local-environ-project-spec-setup"

B-P-H-K-L-E-P-S-S.md

## Projects second branch "netifly-deploy"

I am choosing to deploy the projet to netfily's service for the reason of continoues intergration & development, this means that each new branch that I will version control to Git-Hub will be automatically deployed to Netifly, in turn if & when there is bugs in my project I will be able to debug branch by branch.
