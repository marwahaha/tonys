## Projects second branch "B_2-netifly-deploy"

I am choosing to deploy the projet to netfily's service for the reason of continoues intergration & development, this means that each new branch that I will version control to Git-Hub will be automatically deployed to Netifly, in turn if & when there is bugs in my project I will be able to debug branch by branch.

## Confrim account on Netifly & attach hooks

Dont merge with the command line, push the branch to git hub & then merge on the git hub's clou consiole to see the relevent branche's
